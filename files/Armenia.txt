Programme rationale
1.
Armenia, a lower-middle-income country, has just over 3 million people, about
750,000 of them children. 1 The country is a member of the Eurasian Economic
Union and part of the European Union Neighbourhood Policy. According to
Government predictions, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita will triple by
2025. Armenia is supported by a worldwide network of diaspora communi ties,
which play an active role in shaping national development. Remittances comprise
up to 16 per cent of GDP. One quarter of families have at least one member who has
worked as a labour migrant; about 97 per cent of migrants are men .
2.
The 2013 Integrated Living Conditions Survey (ILCS) estimated overall
poverty at 32 per cent, with child poverty at 37 per cent. 2 At higher risk of child
poverty are the following groups: under-five children; children with three or more
siblings; households with one or more children with disabilities; female-headed
households; and households with no employed adults.3 Regional disparities and
socioeconomic inequalities are significant. Urban residents outside of the capital
comprised 70 per cent of the extreme poor in 2013. Poverty rates vary substantially
across regions (Aragatsotn, 23 per cent; Shirak, 46 per cent) . In 2008, 77.5 per cent
of extremely poor households received family benefits; this fell to 66 per cent by
2013. 4 Since 2010 the Government, with UNICEF and World Bank support, has
initiated a reform of integrated social services aimed at reducing the vulnerability of
children and women by applying the strategies of transformative social work, local
social planning, and cooperation among services.
3.
Armenia has almost halved its infant mortality rate (IMR) since 1990. 5
However, according to the National Statistical Service (NSS), there has been very
little progress in the past five years, with the IMR still at 9.7 in 2013, 6 while the
United Nations Inter-Agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation puts the IMR at
14 for the same year. 7 The 2010 Armenia Demographic and Health Survey (ADHS)
highlighted that children from the poorest households, rural children, and those
whose mothers have only basic education are at notably higher risk of dying before
their first birthday. 8 A significant increase in the number of registered stillbirths has
occurred, from 385 in 2005 to 711 in 2013, 9 which requires further research. In
order to reduce child mortality among disadvantaged groups, the health system
needs to overcome key bottlenecks by taking the following measures: improve
financing mechanisms, thus reducing exposure to formal and informal out -of-pocket
expenditure, strengthen the national capacity to collect, analyse an d use data for
equity-focused programming, and increase cross-sectoral collaboration. The health
system will also need to improve the quality of paediatric care at subnational level,
particularly by strengthening counselling and family support services .

4.
An emerging public health issue is stunting and other forms of undernutrition,
which reached 19 per cent among under-five children in 2010, peaking at 26 per
cent among children aged 36-47 months. Undernutrition significantly contributes to
child mortality, disease and disability. Malnutrition is a related issue requiring
attention. Children from the poorest households, children in rural areas and deprived
regions, or children with mothers with basic education are at higher risk of
malnutrition. Exclusive breastfeeding was only 35 per cent in 2010, the key
bottlenecks being the low level of awareness, an ineffective or inappropriately timed
introduction of complementary feeding, as well as inadequate health/nutrition
counselling and aggressive marketing of breastmilk substitutes. 10 Anaemia
prevalence was high in 2005, at 37 per cent among children aged 6 -59 months and
25 per cent among women of childbearing age. 11
5.
The Government supported early childhood education by opening about
300 kindergartens by 2013 and providing one-year preschools in school buildings.
Largely as a result, preschool enrolment for 3-6 year old children increased from
42 per cent in 2009 to 48 per cent in 2013. 12 However, significant rural-urban
differences exist in enrolment, while children with disabilities and from extremely
poor families also have significantly lower enrolment rates, as low -income rural
communities often cannot afford to finance and maintain preschools.
6.
Gross primary and lower secondary school enrolment are at 94 and 93 per cent,
respectively, while upper-secondary enrolment is at 74 per cent. 13 While there are no
nationwide mechanisms to track children out of school or at risk of dropping out, the
most common risk factors associated with non-attendance are disability, 14 extreme
poverty, child labour, 15 ethnicity, 16 and refugee status.
7.
Disability has drawn more attention in recent years. Armenia ratified the
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2010. There are 8,005 17
children registered with disabilities, about 1 per cent of the child population. Given
the expected 2.5 per cent disability rate, 18,19 around 12,000 more children with
disabilities (an additional 1.5 per cent) are likely to be invisible to the social service
system. Children with disabilities remain among the most marginalized groups,
facing multiple deprivations: 71 per cent of children with disability aged 2 -5 years
do not attend preschool; 18 per cent do not attend school; 12 per cent attend special
schools; 13 per cent live in special schools/orphanages; 34 per cent do not attend
community events; and 73 per cent do not use rehabilitation services.

8.
The country’s significant progress in inclusive education includes the creation of
a legislative basis and financing mechanism. However, only 139 out of 1,400 schools
are inclusive.20 The number of special residential schools has fallen from 40 to 23, 21
with further reductions anticipated.22 In a 2013 survey, 30 per cent of respondents
said that children with intellectual disabilities should be isolated from society, but
more than 95 per cent favoured inclusion of children with physical disabilities.23
9.
Currently 3,630 children still live in 40 institutions providing care and/or
education, including special schools.24 Girls with disabilities are considerably more
likely to be placed in orphanages than boys. 25 Boys are also preferred over girls for
adoption. Poverty is often the sole cause of institutionalization, despite the fact that
the United Nations Guidelines for Alternative Care specify that this should not be the
case.26 Most children in residential care have at least one parent. The cost of
residential care ranges from $3,080 to $5,000 per child annually, while a child with
disability or deprived of parental care who lives with other family members receives
benefits of only about $180-$600 annually. 27 The key bottlenecks leading to family
separations include the lack of community-based services, the lack of a strong State
assistance system for vulnerable families, and non-professionalised child case
management.28
10. Seven in ten children aged 2-14 years experienced psychological or physical
punishment during the 30 days preceding the 2010 ADHS. About one fifth
experienced non-violent discipline; 66 per cent, psychological aggression; 42 per
cent, physical punishment; and 4 per cent, severe physical punishment .
11. A manifestation of gender inequality is the highly skewed ratio of sex at birth:
114 boys were born for every 100 girls in 2012, compared with the expected
102-106 ratio. 29 Because migrant workers comprise mostly boys and men, the
gender imbalance at birth is currently not visible, but may soon have major
implications. In society in general, the incidence of gender-based violence is high. 30

12. In 2014, 31 only 18 juveniles on average were detained at any time. The
Government is addressing key determinants to keeping the number low by
strengthening the capacity of judges, prosecutors and police, with the aim of
increasing protection and avoiding secondary victimization of child ren in contact
with the law. In addition, Armenia requires a strengthened data management system
and comprehensive mechanisms to prevent child offenses and ensure the protection
of child victims and witnesses. 32
13. Young people aged 16-30 identify the key challenges they face: limited
employment opportunities (81 per cent), low salaries (47 per cent), lack of housing
(36 per cent), and poor educational opportunities (13 per cent) . About 78 per cent of
surveyed young people want to leave Armenia, with 42 per cent planning to leave
within three years. 33 Young people from poor families, with disabilities, and in rural
areas are at much greater risk of not taking part in community life and not having
decent job opportunities. Health, education and social protection policies all require
strengthening to become child-friendly. About 40 per cent of school-aged children
have multiple health complaints, and over 25 per cent of 15 -year-old girls and rural
children show symptoms of serious depression. Adolescents have limited contacts
with the health system: some 55 per cent of 11-year-olds have never seen a family
doctor or paediatrician, with an even higher rate in rural areas . 34
14. Armenia is among the 60 most disaster-prone countries, 35 facing nearly
110 types of hazards. The country is prone to earthquakes, 98 per cent of the
population is at risk for drought, and 31 per cent for flooding . 36 Shocks and stress,
including from climate-related hazards, strongly affect the most marginalized and
disadvantaged. Severe environmental challenges include an expanding mining
industry, poor-quality drinking water, air pollution, deforestation and open
landfills, 37 all of which negatively affect the health of children and communities .
15. The NSS has championed the introduction of methodologies to improve social
statistics and produce high-quality national data: a multidimensional poverty index
was established with World Bank assistance, while Multiple Overlapping Deprivation
Analysis will be conducted with UNICEF technical support in 2015. While all NSS
regional offices have the ArmeniaInfo database, decision makers seldom use this
system. Moreover, administrative data remain inconsistent and lack an equity focus,
and data from various ministries and organizations are often incompa tible. A more
reliable national data management system on child rights is needed.

Programme priorities and partnerships
16. The programme will contribute to the following national priorities: 2014 -2025
Armenia Development Strategy, National Plan of Action on Human Rights
Protection, 2016-2020 State Programme of Education Development, National
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Strategy, State Strategic Programme on Child
Rights Protection 2013-2016, and the United Nations Decade of Education for
Sustainable Development.
17. The country programme will support the country’s efforts towards greater social
inclusion, especially for the most deprived children. It will contribute to the
implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and assist with State
follow-up to the 2013 Concluding Observations of the Committee on the Rights of the
Child. The cooperation will be framed by the Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons
with Disabilities, and it will pursue the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable
development agenda, while linking to the UNICEF Strategic Plan, 2014 -2017. The
programme is closely aligned with the United Nations Development Assistance
Framework (UNDAF) 2016-2020 at the level of outcomes and strategies, and will
contribute to the achievement of the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals.
18. Key lessons learned during the current country programme highlighted the
need for further investment in inter-sectoral cooperation. This particularly applies to
addressing issues of children who face multiple deprivations, and reinforces the
need for alignment of childcare system policies with integrated health, social
protection and inclusive education reforms.
19. The Multi Country Evaluation (MCE) of Early Childhood Education
recommended strengthening learning outcomes and quality assurance, as well as
directing Government allocations towards the most deprived areas/families,
including children with disabilities. 38 The MCE of Inclusive Quality Education noted
the growing number of children with disabilities attending regular schools and the
effectiveness of education programmes that promote social inclusion. It recommended
focusing more on the quality of inclusive education, and on operationalizing the
national strategy on transformation of special schools. 39 The MCE of Access to
Justice suggested further collaboration with the European Union, within its broader
engagement in governance and human rights issues. 40
20. As a reliable partner and a strong, independent voice for children ’s rights,
UNICEF will promote the inclusion of the most deprived children in national
policies, convening partners around a child rights-related agenda and providing
high-level international technical expertise. Alliances for children will be further
strengthened with civil society, including the Child Protection Network of 40 local/
international organizations, the DRR National Platform and its Thematic Groups on
Education, persons with disabilities and gender, and the Alliance of Disability NGOs
(non-governmental organizations). Engagement with parliamentarians, academia,
human rights institutions, youth organizations and associations of parents will be

strengthened. UNICEF will invest in diaspora networks to support child rights-related
reforms and will explore involving the private sector in corporate social responsibility,
in line with the Children’s Rights and Business Principles. UNICEF will continue its
close collaboration with the European Union to place children’s rights in the European
Neighbourhood Policy, as well as with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund,
Asian Development Bank (ADB) and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) on social/child protection and DRR.

Survival, health and development of children aged 0-6 years
21. Overall, the objective of this programme component is to address equity gaps
in the health system and increase access to inclusive kindergartens of vulnerable
children and their families in social services. Building on the well-developed
primary health-care structure as the best channel to access families with young
children, and in cooperation with education and social services, it will ensure early
identification of children with malnutrition, health problems, developmental delays
and maltreatment, aiming to ensure the provision of care and support, as well as
increased promotion of healthy behaviours.
22. The programme will identify and address underlying systemic bottleneck s and
equity gaps in infant mortality, by increasing sustainable State financing for child
health care, strengthening data reliability/management, improving quality assurance
and capacity for service delivery, and supporting the introduction of the child
nutrition surveillance system. In order to reduce child mortality among the most
vulnerable families, priority will be given to strengthening neonatal and paediatric
care at subnational level, improving referral mechanisms and immunization services .
23. The programme component will contribute to strengthening policies and
mechanisms that promote sound nutrition and prevent micronutrient deficiencies, by
improving home-visiting and counselling services and by providing adequate
support to families, including to improve their health behaviours. Attention will be
given to public health interventions, such as flour fortification, and to enhanced
multi-sectoral coordination at national, family and community levels.
24. The programme will support early identification/early intervention to prevent
developmental delays and disabilities through refining health providers ’ functional
responsibilities and capacities, so that parents can be trained in appropriate
parenting techniques.
25. The programme will enable preschool expansion and inclusiveness by
designing alternative models for remote, sparsely populated communities;
strengthening professionals’ capacities and practices; providing policy advice to
address inclusion; and supporting improved data management . It will focus on
sustainable State financing to reduce gaps in access to inclusive preschools, and will
promote effective community models, such as fee waivers for the poorest families,
subsidized by other parents.

The right of children to live in a caring and supportive
family environment
26. This second programme component’s overall objective is to strengthen
resilience and coping mechanisms of families, thereby contributing to a safe, caring
and supportive environment for their children. It will sharpen the focus of social
services on vulnerable families with children, particularly those in extreme poverty.
27. The programme will support coping mechanisms (resilience) of families
through the provision of efficient, effective State monetary assistance a nd
specialized services. The programme will strengthen the synergies between child
and social protection systems. This will include proposing schemes of reallocation
of residential care-related State expenditures towards family-like solutions,
including for children with disabilities.
28. This will involve sustaining reform of integrated social services, focusing on
case management, local social planning, cooperation among services, and the
expansion of professional social workers in communities. UNICEF will advise the
Government on social cash transfer reform for increased coverage of extremely poor
children, including urban settlements with the highest extreme poverty rates among
children. 41 The programme will seek to reduce deprivation of parental care an d
support reunification of children in State care with their biological families or their
placement in alternative family care. At the same time, the programme component
will support the establishment of a legal framework and community services to
respond to the needs of vulnerable children, including children in emergencies .
29. This component will also support scaling up of the identification, monitoring
and response mechanisms for all children out of school or at risk of dropout, based
on lessons learned from modelling this approach at the subnational level in one
region. Robust data management systems will be complemented by cooperation
among education, health, child protection and social protection authorities at
community and regional levels.
30. The programme will strengthen the Government’s capacity for multi-hazard
risk assessment and address needs/concerns of children in the most disaster-prone
areas. UNICEF will share its global experience under the Core Commitments for
Children in Humanitarian Action (CCC) and promote the use of these guidelines by
national emergency services. The programme will support the expansion of the
social protection system’s response in emergencies and strengthening the resilience
of families and children. The role of girls and women in DRR will be prioritized in
recognition of their contribution to protecting and rebuilding communities before/
after disasters. Because two thirds of students attend schools that do not comply
with earthquake-resistant construction codes, the programme will introduce a costeffective system for building resilient schools that are seismically safe, energy efficient and inclusive.
31. The programme component will develop a national youth policy framework to
promote the inclusion of vulnerable adolescents and young people into sectoral
strategies. It will include developing community mechanisms for youth engagement
in the policy settings and budget planning to foster the non -discriminatory and
meaningful participation of vulnerable adolescents and young people at

E/ICEF/2015/P/L.7

community/regional levels. An integrated approach oriented to equity and based on
the health system will be modelled to help to ensure that the health needs of
adolescents are met in a timely and comprehensively manner.

Enhancement of the realization of the rights of children
with disabilities
32. Children with disabilities face multiple deprivations and need a continuum of
services. This component’s overall objective is to reduce bottlenecks in policy and
legislation, budgeting and availability of services for children with disabilities, and
to promote societal attitudes conducive to their full inclusion. Overall, this
component will contribute to the needs of children with disabilities being reflected
in education, health, child protection, justice and DRR policies and programmes.
33. The programme will work to give children with disabilities greater visibility in
national data collection, through strengthening of cross-sectoral data management
so that State policies/budgeting are better informed. The Government’s efforts to
improve the assessment of disability will be aligned with the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), by revising criteria of
eligibility for benefits/services.
34. Within this programme component, the Government will establish and expand
existing rehabilitation services within the primary health-care system, as well as
create community-based after-school care, development and respite services for
children with disabilities and their families. Fostering cross-sectoral cooperation
among education, health, child protection and social protection services for children
with disabilities will be a key strategy to strengthen the exchange of information
and referral mechanisms among outpatient health facilities, preschools and social
services.
35. The national inclusive education system will be strengthened by transforming
special schools into teaching support centres, developing the capacity of
teaching/administrative staff, revising special-education needs assessments based on
the ICF, changing funding mechanisms and improving quality of instruction . The
programme will further work to ensure that positive experiences and lessons learned
from inclusive school policies and programmes are reflected in preschools.
36. To reduce stigma and increase the participation of children with disabilities,
this component will also focus on addressing social norms in preschools and
schools, as well as on reducing the public’s acceptance of child abandonment
because of disability by raising awareness of the rights of children with disabilities,
promoting equal access to education and encouraging inclusive values and respect
for diversity.

Access to justice for children
37. Building on the reform of criminal and civil legislation and accompanying
procedural codes, this component will assist efforts to establish a fair, timely and
effective judicial system for children, as well as a child rights monitoring system,
that can address violations of rights for the most vulnerable children.

15-06111

9/18

E/ICEF/2015/P/L.7

38. The programme will support the legal reform process so that new laws
safeguard the best interests of the child in contact with the civil, criminal or
administrative justice system, including through the provision o f child-sensitive
procedures and information. It will further contribute to strengthening justice
professionals’ capacity to work with children in conflict with the law. It will also
contribute to the development of policies and services to protect the rig hts of
children in contact with the law — child victims/witnesses in particular — in order
to reduce obstacles these children face in accessing justice and to prevent secondary
victimization.
39. To facilitate the implementation of all rights under the Co nvention on the
Rights of the Child and under national laws, the programme will promote a
participatory approach so that marginalized children have a voice in combating
discrimination and experience the realization of their right to an effective remedy.
This will be accomplished through measures including the provision of child sensitive alternative mechanisms to solving disputes and seeking redress as well as
the provision of appropriate reparation measures. This component will continue to
support strengthened independent monitoring of child rights by the National Human
Rights Defender’s Office (HRDO), including through enhancing direct access of
children to the HRDO and preparing specialized child rights reports to the President
and Parliament. The role of NGOs as part of an independent monitoring system will
be promoted.
40. This component will also enable a more child-oriented approach to policy,
programme and service design at all levels following relevant institutional
mandates. Service provision will increasingly focus on the specific needs of the
child and on better referral systems, with the expected result of a sharpened equity
focus and greater progress in the realization of the rights of the most vulnerable .

Programme and risk management
41. This country programme document outlines UNICEF contrib utions to national
results and serves as the primary unit of accountability to the Executive Board for
results alignment and resources assigned to the programme at country level.
Accountabilities of managers at the country, regional and headquarters levels with

respect to country programmes are prescribed in the organization ’s programme and
operations policies and procedures.
42. The main risks to expected results relate to safety/security in light of the
uncertain economic environment, high exposure to disaster, and reduced fundraising
opportunities for a middle-income country. Mitigation measures will include
fostering a strong commitment of stakeholders to account for their actions in policy
reforms involving multiple line ministries, a risk-informed planning approach,
mainstreaming of DRR, close partnerships with all levels of governance,
establishment of permanent multi-sectoral commissions, diversification/leveraging
of funding sources, as well as close monitoring of the harmonized approach to cash
transfers. The focus will be on further developing the capacity of the State and on
enhancing national ownership of the programme, so as to secure public funding for
its continuation beyond 2020.
43. The United Nations will establish mechanisms to coordinate planning,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the UNDAF, to which the country
programme will directly contribute. As a basis for developing workplans to
operationalize the country programme, UNICEF and the Government will agree on
detailed results to be achieved by the cooperation.
44. As noted, UNICEF will work to leverage and mobilize resources for children
by strengthening partnerships with Government, civil society and private sector
partners, including by further enhancing partnerships with USAID, the World Bank,
European Union and ADB. Opportunities for subregional programmes will be
explored.

Monitoring and evaluation
45. The country programme will monitor barriers and bottlenecks faced by the
most disadvantaged children in order to develop the most adequate strategies to help
to reduce socioeconomic disparities. It will assist in establishing an equity-focused
monitoring system to regularly inform policy and decision -making, with indicators
agreed with partners and showing high disaggregation, based on internationally
recognized standards.
46. The country programme will invest in harmonizing social statistics on child
rights across State bodies to align with international standards, promoting the
establishment of a designated institution to engage line ministries in implementing
child rights policies in accordance with the Concluding Observations of the
Committee on the rights of the Child. It will periodically publish a report on the
state of children in Armenia.
47. Programme baselines will rely on the 2015 ADHS, the ILCS and Government
administrative data. Child poverty data will be monitored based on the annual report
on Social Snapshot and Poverty in Armenia and by using multiple overlapping
deprivation analysis. Each key programme component will be externally evaluated
in line with UNICEF evaluation policies.
48. Specific surveys on children with disabilities, children in residential care and
other vulnerable groups will be conducted to monitor trends in disparities, including
those regarding gender. Key evaluations will assess the effectiveness of family - and
community-based alternative services and their role in the prevention of

institutionalization, the nutritional status of children and its dynamics, and the
effectiveness of inter-sectoral mechanisms to monitor children out of school or at
risk of dropout. The programme will systematically track progress against planned
results through midyear and annual reviews.
49. Based on the good practices of Armenia, the country progra mme will invest in
evaluating and documenting good practices and lessons learned to contribute to
child rights realization beyond Armenian borders.
